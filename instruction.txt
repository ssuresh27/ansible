anisble-config list #Lists all the configurations

anisble-config view #Shows the current/active config file

anisble-config dump #Shows current setting of vairable

ex:-
anisble-config dump|grep GATHERING


ansible-config --version       
In this case I had no configuration file (config file = None) so I generated an empty one (option --disabled means all entries are commented out) in the current directory with

% ansible-config init --disabled > ansible.cfg


host_key_checking = false

#System build factor
ansible localhost -m setup

By default in Mac you would not get file /etc/ansible/hosts

Work around is to set ENV variable

ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/Users/your-user-name/.ansible.cfg
and create a file.

 ~/.ansible.cfg
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False
DEFAULT_HOST_LIST = /Users/your-user-name/.ansible/hosts
inventory =  /Users/your-user-name/.ansible/hosts
